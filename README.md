## Overview

This is my personal portfolio and blog site. It is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

I build this project to learn Astro and to have a place to share my thoughts and projects.

I'm planning to write about web development, software engineering, and other topics that interest me.

I'm also planning to share some of my projects and experiments.

I hope you will find something interesting here.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

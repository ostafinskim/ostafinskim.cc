        '❞ Miro took a stab at building a website for a family member, and that was it: the beginning of what we expect to be a long and fruitful journey into web development.',
        "Whilst still working as a meter technician for Anglian Water, Miro started reading around to learn more about web development, took some free online training courses, and wondered about coding full-time as a career rather than a side project. He took the plunge and signed up for a bootcamp, which he did in his spare time. He then successfully applied for an internship at a company developing a custom eCommerce platform.",
